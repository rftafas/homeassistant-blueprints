Repository Overview

This is a Home Assistant blueprints repository that provides high-quality, validated blueprints for automations, scripts, and templates. The repository includes automated validation, semantic versioning, and a GitHub Pages catalog for easy blueprint discovery and installation.
Development Commands
Validation

# Validate YAML syntax for a blueprint
python -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('blueprints/path/to/blueprint.yaml'))"

Testing

No formal test suite is present. Validation is performed through:

    YAML syntax validation
    Home Assistant blueprint schema validation (via GitHub Actions)
    Manual testing in Home Assistant environments

Input Organization Pattern

Use sectioned inputs (requires HA 2024.6.0+) in this specific order:

    main_config: Core configuration (sensors, devices, targets)
    threshold_config: Timing thresholds, delays, and trigger conditions
    notification_config: Notification settings and services
    advanced_settings: Optional settings (collapsed by default)

Naming Conventions

    Blueprint names: Title case, descriptive, under 50 characters
    Input keys: snake_case (e.g., motion_sensor, delay_time)
    File names: kebab-case (e.g., motion-activated-light.yaml)

Essential Blueprint Patterns

    Use !input for referencing inputs
    Define variables section for commonly used values
    Use appropriate selectors with filters for better UX
    Provide sensible defaults for all optional inputs
    Use mode: single for single-entity automations (one door, one sensor)
    Use mode: parallel only for multi-entity automations that can run simultaneously
    Always include max_exceeded: silent to prevent log spam
    Use threshold_config for timing-related settings (delays, intervals, thresholds)
    Collapse threshold_config and advanced_settings sections by default

Home Assistant Integration

    Blueprints are designed for ESPHome integration (especially air quality sensors)
    Support for standard HA notification services
    Compatible with domain-specific device classes (motion, temperature, etc.)

Automation Mode Selection

    single: For single-entity automations (one sensor, one device)
    parallel: Only for multi-entity automations that can safely run concurrently
    Always include max_exceeded: silent

Semantic Versioning

Commit messages determine version bumps:

    Major (x.0.0): breaking change, breaking:, major:, !:, incompatible
    Minor (1.x.0): feat:, feature:, add:, new:, enhancement
    Patch (1.0.x): fix:, patch:, bug:, hotfix:, chore:, docs:, style:

Blueprint Quality Standards
Validation Requirements

All blueprints must pass:

    YAML syntax validation
    Home Assistant blueprint schema compliance
    Best practice compliance checks

User Experience Standards

    Clear, helpful descriptions with markdown formatting
    Appropriate input selectors with domain/device_class filters
    Logical input grouping with descriptive sections
    Sensible default values for all optional inputs
    Recovery/clear notifications for alert-based automations

Critical Safety Patterns

For safety-critical blueprints (like CO monitoring):

    Implement repeated alerts for critical conditions
    Use appropriate alert priorities and actions
    Provide clear action guidance in notifications
    Include clear thresholds based on safety standards

Development Workflow

    Create blueprint in appropriate category folder
    Follow naming conventions and metadata requirements
    Use conventional commit messages for proper versioning
    GitHub Actions handles validation and publishing automatically
    Blueprints are published to GitHub Pages catalog with import buttons
